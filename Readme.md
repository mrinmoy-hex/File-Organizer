# File Organizer

## Overview

The File Organizer is a Python script that organizes files in a specified directory into subfolders based on their file extensions. Files without extensions are moved to a folder named `No Extension`. You can also specify a different target directory where the organized files will be moved.

## Features

- Organizes files into folders based on their extensions.
- Handles files without extensions by placing them in a `No Extension` folder.
- Allows the user to specify a target directory for organizing files.
- Logs actions such as directory creation, file movement, and errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x


## Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python file_organizer.py
    ```

2. Enter the path of the directory you want to organize.

3. Optionally, enter the target directory where the organized files should be moved. If you leave this blank, files will be organized within the same directory.

4. The script will organize the files and log the process.
